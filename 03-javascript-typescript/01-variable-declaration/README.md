## How to define variables in typescript

var, let, const and static types of variables.

## EX.

- create an variable called `randomNumbers`.
- using a for loop, iterate 10 times and populate the `randomNumbers` array with 10 random numbers using `Math.random()`.
- From the `randomNumbers` array create another array called `powNumbers` which will iterate on the previous array and contain 10 numbers which are the power of 2 of the `randomNumbers`
- make sure you are able to run your code using vscode debugger and place breakpoints in your code.
